Powertools for AWS Lambda (.NET) is a developer toolkit to implement Serverless [best practices and increase developer velocity](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda-dotnet/#features).

> Also available in [Java](https://github.com/aws-powertools/powertools-lambda-java), [Typescript](https://github.com/aws-powertools/powertools-lambda-typescript), and [Python](https://github.com/aws-powertools/powertools-lambda-python).

## Features

Powertools for AWS Lambda (.NET) provides three core utilities:

* **[Logging](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda/dotnet/core/logging/)** - provides a custom logger class that outputs structured JSON. It allows you to pass in strings or more complex objects, and will take care of serializing the log output. Common use casesâ€”such as logging the Lambda event payload and capturing cold start informationâ€”are handled for you, including appending custom keys to the logger at anytime.

* **[Metrics](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda/dotnet/core/metrics/)** - makes collecting custom metrics from your application simple, without the need to make synchronous requests to external systems. This functionality is powered by [Amazon CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format (EMF)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Embedded_Metric_Format.html), which allows for capturing metrics asynchronously.

* **[Tracing](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda/dotnet/core/tracing/)** - provides a simple way to send traces from functions to AWS X-Ray to provide visibility into function calls, interactions with other AWS services, or external HTTP requests. Annotations can easily be added to traces to allow filtering traces based on key information. For example, when using Tracer, a ColdStart annotation is created for you so you can easily group and analyze traces where there was an initialization overhead.

* **[Parameters](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda/dotnet/utilities/parameters/)** - provides high-level functionality to retrieve one or multiple parameter values from [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html), [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/), or [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/). We also provide extensibility to bring your own providers.

* **[Idempotency](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda/dotnet/utilities/idempotency/)** - The idempotency utility provides a simple solution to convert your Lambda functions into idempotent operations which are safe to retry.

* **[Batch Processing](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda/dotnet/utilities/batch-processing/)** - The batch processing utility handles partial failures when processing batches from Amazon SQS, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, and Amazon DynamoDB Streams.

### Installation

The Powertools for AWS Lambda (.NET) utilities (.NET 6 and .NET 8) are available as NuGet packages. You can install the packages from [NuGet Gallery](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=AWS+Lambda+Powertools*) or from Visual Studio editor by searching `AWS.Lambda.Powertools*` to see various utilities available.

* [AWS.Lambda.Powertools.Logging](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=AWS.Lambda.Powertools.Logging):

    `dotnet add package AWS.Lambda.Powertools.Logging`

* [AWS.Lambda.Powertools.Metrics](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=AWS.Lambda.Powertools.Metrics):

    `dotnet add package AWS.Lambda.Powertools.Metrics`

* [AWS.Lambda.Powertools.Tracing](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=AWS.Lambda.Powertools.Tracing):

    `dotnet add package AWS.Lambda.Powertools.Tracing`

* [AWS.Lambda.Powertools.Parameters](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=AWS.Lambda.Powertools.Parameters):

    `dotnet add package AWS.Lambda.Powertools.Parameters`

* [AWS.Lambda.Powertools.Idempotency](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=AWS.Lambda.Powertools.Idempotency):

    `dotnet add package AWS.Lambda.Powertools.Idempotency`

* [AWS.Lambda.Powertools.BatchProcessing](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=AWS.Lambda.Powertools.BatchProcessing):

    `dotnet add package AWS.Lambda.Powertools.BatchProcessing`

## Examples

We have provided examples focused specifically on each of the utilities. Each solution comes with an AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) templates to run your functions as a Zip package using the AWS Lambda .NET 6 or .NET 8 managed runtime; or as a container package using the AWS base images for .NET.
